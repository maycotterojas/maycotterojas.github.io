      <h2>maycotterojas</h2>
      <p>Hello, my name is (Julia) Maycotte-Rojas. I am an incoming transfer student into Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo.<br>
      Considering the human condition is key when creating a system whose goal is to serve society.<br>
      My goal is to attain the embodiment of the experience when systems are being made, throught every step of the design process.<br>
      Valuing human interaction between systems - comes from my incessant observing that makes me hungry to know more about how these structural forms can interact with fluidity; by considering how human form interacts with these systems.<br>
      This will be continued by understanding people through form, and thoughtful improvements of existing systems and interactions - via engineering.</p>
